	<h3> Train to Busan (2016) </h3>
	<p>Definitely one of my favorite zombie movies. It’s probably overhyped at this point but I’m going to keep hyping it up. It was made in South Korea and I think most of us know that South Korea and Japan make the best horror movies and South Korea is tearing up the zombie scene right now especially. 
	<br>
	Like the title states the movie is about a train to Busan. The story revolves around a businessman father taking his daughter to go see her mother who he is divorced from. The film talks a lot about social issues where in Korean culture the businessmen place themselves in a higher authority and don’t care about anyone else but themselves. The movie makes me cry and legitimately scared because of the claustrophobic environment of a train filled with zombies. If you haven’t seen this film, you can watch it on Netflix right now if you’re interested.
