	<h3> Autopsy of Jane Doe (2016) </h3>
	<p> When I first saw the name Autopsy of Jane Doe I was so underwhelmed. I had such low expectations for this movie which maybe is why it’s one of my favorite paranormal horror films. It was scary and the mystery lying behind Jane Doe was so interesting to watch unfold as the main characters which were a father and son team had to discover what happened to this young woman. Surprisingly a lot of critics hated the ending of the film but that was my favorite. It really brought everything together and even back to reality and references historical events. The relationship of the father and son is kind of ignored in place of the body but that’s okay in my opinion, not everything should be about the benefit of the protagonist. It’s kind of cool to see the importance mostly placed on the entity haunting the film to begin with. </p> </td>
